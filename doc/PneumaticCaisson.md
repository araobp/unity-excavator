# Pneumatic Caisson

Back in January 2020, I visited a very large construction site in Tokyo. A construction site director explained the vistors what was going on under the ground. I just saw the excavator in the video there. The machine was very surprising to me, and the working environment was very dangerous... Machine learning and AI could have improved safety of the environment.
